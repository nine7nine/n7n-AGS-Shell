# n7n-AGS-Shell / Hyprland

My own spin on Aylur's Gtk Shell + dotfiles. Aylur's AGS desktop is great, but some of it is very specific to their
own needs, thus I decided to hack away and come up with something more generalized and suitable for me...

## Warning!!! 

Work-In-Progress. Rebasing on the latest TS based AGS/Dotfiles.

For now it runs with some surface level tweaks, but much of my functionality needs to be reworked / added back.
